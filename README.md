Initially this began as frustrating exercise in condensing a large amount of broad overview information into applying to a 1st webpage.  I did not feel prepared to get started.  After my intial frustration, I realized, I was not expected to have the knowledge to do a perfect job without referencing earlier lessons, searching google, and seeing what others did.  I finally saw this as a lesson in primarily resources, and an experience to take me from "What the fuck am I doing?" to "Oh, I have some ideas on how to do this!"  The first try does not have to be the best!
